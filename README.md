## Setup

Using a PostgreSQL database:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up
```

Using a SQLite database:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.sqlite.yml up
```

The default port of the running webserver is `80`.

### Instance specific configuration

Add a page for data privacy by creating a file at `app/views/pages/data_privacy.html.haml`.

### Backups

All data is stored in the database. It is thus sufficient to backup the database.

If PostgreSQL is used: use `pg_dump` to backup the database specified in `DATABASE_URL`.

If SQLite is used: backup the `.sqlite3` file specified in `DATABASE_URL`. If a relative path is used to specify the database file, it is relative to the directory `/app`.

## Development

```shell
bin/setup
bin/dev
```

## Environment variables

- `DEVISE_SENDER_EMAIL`: the email address you are sending emails from
- `DATABASE_URL`: allows to set the database. PostgreSQL or SQLite3 are supported.

    Example for SQLite3:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite3:db/development.sqlite3
    ```
